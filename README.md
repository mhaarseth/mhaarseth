# Welcome!

Born on GeoCities, raised at Noroff.

## About me

My name is Magnus Haarseth, I have just finished studying Front End Development at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. I made my first webpage at fifteen, made using notepad and hosted on GeoCities. I then spent my entire life doing other things, before coming back to web dev at 40.

## Skills

During my years at Noroff I have learnt HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and React. For personal projects I prefer using React and CSS Modules.
